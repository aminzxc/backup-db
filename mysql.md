```
### Once logged in, you can list your databases using the following command
```
SHOW DATABASES;
```
### To perform a full backup of a specific database, use the mysqldump command followed by the database name
```
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql
```
### if you want to back up multiple databases, you can use the `--databases` option followed by the database names
```
mysqldump -u username -p --databases database1 database2 > backup.sql
```
### To back up all databases on the MySQL server, use the `--all-databases` option
```
mysqldump -u username -p --all-databases > backup.sql
```
### Note: Make sure you have sufficient privileges to perform the backup. The user should have the `SELECT` privilege on the database(s) being backed up
